## Intro

Classes are mandatory as well as there will be a lot of participation acitvities in class.

The first part is talking about software engineering and what it actually is, there are many different definitions but in summary it is someone who designs quality software to solve a real world problem.

## Class 6/3/2025

Process is a step by step structure with milestones and stages while methodology is a way of interacting with the stakeholders to move them from stage to stage.

Software Process: is a model that describes an approach to the production and evolution of software.

Software Methodology: identifies how to preform acitvities for each period, how to represent the activities and products and how to generate products.

### Software Development Life Cycle

1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Verfication
5. Maintenance

#### Requirements

Requirement - a **non-technical** definition of features that usres expect from the system. ***NO JARGON!***

Specification - Tehnical definition of what is required for building system. We arent trying to design it so, ***keep it simple!***

Specification types:

1. functional
2. performance
3. interace
4. Maintainability
5. reliability
6. safety
7. quality

#### WRSPM Reference Model

(World Machine Model)

- Requirements are always in the problem domain.
- Software specification is in the computer domain.
- There are several levels of abstraction in between.

- We want to make a change in the enviroment.
- We will build sosme system to do it.
- This system must intereact with the enviroment.

#### Recording Requirements

- UML: The unified modeling language lets you specify how parts of the system should work. It uses several kinds of diagrams to represent diffferent pieces of the system.
- User stories: A shorty story explaining how the system will let the user do something. They are easy to write to understand and can cover any situation that you can imagine
- Use caes: A description of a series of interactions between actors.
- Prototypes: A porotype is  mockup of some or all of the application.
